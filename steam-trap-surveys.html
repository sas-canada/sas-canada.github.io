                    Leaking steam traps will lead to high cost of operation in any industry. Boiler uses energy to generate steam and in the steam distribution system, presence of condensate and non-condensable gases will increase the rate at which condensate forms. If the condensate is not removed from the steam system, it will create water hammer issues as water moves at steam velocities. This will not only cause failure to installed equipment in line but also cause inefficiencies with heat transfer due to wet steam. Steam Trap must be operational, sized and selected for the right application.<br/>
                    Steam distribution and temperature is controlled by pressure. When steam traps fail in close position, customer will experience lack of process temperature control, which will increase cost of operation due to inefficiencies in production, increased downtime and premature equipment failure. When steam traps fail in open position, the condensate pressure and temperature will increase causing system imbalance and increased system back pressure. This will cause every other installed Steam Trap to discharge less amount of condensate due to decrease in differential pressure across the Steam Trap. <br/>
                    Steam Traps should be tested every year just like any control valve. There are three methods to test steam traps. Temperature, visual and sound. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. The best way to test Steam Traps is to use all methods. Steam Traps should be tested every 3 months until the failure rate drops to 3% or lower. Once the failure rate is 3%, then Steam Traps should be tested every 6 months.
